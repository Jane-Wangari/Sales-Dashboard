# Introduction
One of the most significant departments in any organization is the sales department. The department plays a pivotal role in promoting the success of the business. Sales play a unique and essential role in bridging the gap between the company's products and services, and the potential customer needs to promote customer satisfaction. Sales impact a company's success as they build customer business trust. 

Analysis of sales data is normally done to help in protecting the organizations cashflow and also help it solving problems and making decisions. This kind of analysis also helps to better understand the companys performace in terms of undersatanding customers, products the comapany is selling and its employees performance.

# Project Overview
The analysis aims to analyze the company's revenue trends over the years by examining how it generates revenue from different channels; product categories, segments, shipping modes, regions and sales teams.
The Sales team manager sales summary table.

# Data Sourcing
The data was shared in the 30 Days analytics learning platform. The dataset consists of five tables in which a connection was created to create relationships between the tables for analysis and visualization.

# Data Cleaning
## Microsoft PowerBI
The data was loaded into PowerBI as an Excel workbook, and all five tables were read into PowerBI and transformed.
I cleaned the data using the power query editor and the Power BI desktop to visualize the insights from my analysis.

# Data Cleaning Process
Data cleaning is a process that prepares data for analysis by removing and modifying incorrect, irrelevant, incomplete, improperly formatted, and duplicated data.
After importing the data to Power BI as an Excel Workbook, I transformed it based on the entire dataset.

## Power Query
In the power Query editor, remove blank rows from the Sales Rep table, the Product table, and the customer table, and transform the data to use the first rows as headers.
Load the data to the PowerBI Desktop for insights.

## PowerBI Desktop
Created the following DAX measures to help in visualization; Types of products, Average sales, Order Date, Previous Month, Revenue, Revenue (Without Organic), Ship Date, Total Discount, Total Products, Total Profit, regions, and Discount Amount.
# Analysis
After cleaning and transforming the dataset, I analyzed it to derive insights into the sales data.
1. The total number of customers and states under consideration.
2. Total revenue, total profits and total products sold.
3. Revenue by year
4. The proportion of revenue by region.
5. Revenue generated by each member of the sales team
6. Total revenue generated depends on ship mode.
7. Revenue generated for each product category.
8. Total discount by category
9. Table summarizing Team managers' data; their regions, total products they could sell, and the revenue and profit they generated.
