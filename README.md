# Introduction
One of the most significant departments in any organization is the sales department. The department plays a pivotal role in promoting the success of the business. Sales play a unique and essential role in bridging the gap between the company's products and services, and the potential customer needs to promote customer satisfaction. Sales impact a company's success as they build customer business trust.

# Project Overview
The analysis aims to analyze the company's revenue trends over the years by examining how it generates revenue from different channels; product categories, segments, shipping modes, regions and sales teams.
The Sales team manager sales summary table.

# Data Sourcing
The data was shared in the 30 Days analytics learning platform. The dataset consists of five tables in which a connection was created to create relationships between the tables for analysis and visualization.

# Data Cleaning
## Microsoft PowerBI
The data was loaded into PowerBI as an Excel workbook, and all five tables were read into PowerBI and transformed.
I cleaned the data using the power query editor and the Power BI desktop to visualize the insights from my analysis.

# Data Cleaning Process
Data cleaning is a process that prepares data for analysis by removing and modifying incorrect, irrelevant, incomplete, improperly formatted, and duplicated data.
After importing the data to Power BI as an Excel Workbook, I transformed it based on the entire dataset.

## Power Query
In the power Query editor, remove blank rows from the Sales Rep table, the Product table, and the customer table, and transform the data to use the first rows as headers.
Load the data to the PowerBI Desktop for insights.

## PowerBI Desktop
Created the following DAX measures to help in visualization; Types of products, Average sales, Order Date, Previous Month, Revenue, Revenue (Without Organic), Ship Date, Total Discount, Total Products, Total Profit, regions, and Discount Amount.

# Conclusions
Out of the 38K products sold from the 1850 product types of 3 categories, from the analysis, the following conclusions were made;
There was a steady rise in the company’s revenue from 2015 to 2017; the company generated more profits during this period.
The company generated most of its revenue from the East and West regions.
Most of the company's revenue was from Organic, with the Charlie sales team at the top in generating revenue.
All categories are performing averagely well in generating revenue with technology at the lead.
Furniture items offer the most discounts, with the office category having a low discount.
Over the years, the company has shown a positive trend in profit generation; more profits are generated yearly.
Alisha Cordwell and Britanny Bold, Sales Team managers, have recorded a loss in their sales while Tracy Banks records the highest revenue.

# Recommendations
Expand the company's business to more states to increase revenue.
Train and motivate the company’s managers and sales team to ensure they are more productive to generate more revenue and profits.
Constantly provide discounts on items to increase purchases and products.
Increase the number of product categories to offer more variety to the customers.
Set a weekly or monthly target for the managers and sales teams to avoid instances of encountering losses.
Engage customers for feedback to achieve ultimate customer satisfaction, which will help generate more revenue and profits.
Improve all shipping modes to make them more efficient so that each can generate more revenue.

# Assumption
The organic is taken as the sales made without going through any sales team
